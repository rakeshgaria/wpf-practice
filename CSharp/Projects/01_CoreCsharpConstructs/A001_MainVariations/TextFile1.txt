Specifying an Application Error Code

By convention, returning the value 0 indicates the program has terminated successfully, while another value (such as -1)
represents an error condition. Be aware that the value 0 is automatically returned, even if you construct a
Main() method prototyped to return void.

When using top-level statements (and therefore no Main() method), if the executing code returns an
integer, that is the return code. If nothing is explicitly returned, it still returns 0, as with explicitly using a
Main() method.
